# Responsive Health Product Landing Page with HTML, CSS, Javascript
I built a landing page for a health watch that can read blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature.
The landing page uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build beautiful interfaces that promote the product and increases customer interaction.
I designed the page to feature the products in different background colours which can be seen when you move your mouse over a thumbnail. The website is highly responsive on tablets and small android phones.  Find the website here: [Health-Watch-Landing-Page](https://health-watch-product-page.netlify.app/)
